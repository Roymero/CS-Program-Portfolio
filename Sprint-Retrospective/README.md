# Sprint Retrospective
- You listen to users and extract the specific features they asked for from their stories, then you present those features to your team to start brainstorming.
- My approach to developing programs is to listen properly at the daily scrum, understand what my responisiblities are, determine if my tasks are reliant on other groups, and gauge the success of my development while also learning during sprint review.
- Being a good team member means contributing high-quality work, communicating properly with your team and trusting your team to do their part.
