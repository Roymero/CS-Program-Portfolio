# The Gaming Room 

## About
- The Gaming Room is a software gaming company that wants to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their current game, Draw It or Lose It, which is currently available in an Android app only.
- The research on the different platforms and comparing all the different platforms with their pros/cons is something I believe I did very well.
- The design document is a layout for how the code should be developed so having that next to me made it easier for me to code since I only had to focus on the coding portion.
- If I could choose one section to revise it would be the design constraints. With what I learned in the time elapsed since I initially wrote the design constraints I would probably alter the current ones and add around two more.
- I interpreted the users needs by picturing myself and my friends as users. What features would be helpful? what aspects or services would boost the quality of life of the game experience? It's extremely important to think of the user's needs when creating a program/game because they are the ones sacrificing their time to use our product. Even if we have the most captivating, fun, unique game if the application is slog to use our initial user base is going to be extremely minimal and our continued user base is going to decrease rapidly.
- I approach designing software with multiple drafts. I think of different tools and solutions for the software I want to design, weigh the pros and cons, then choose the most optimal solution and start designing. For future software development, I'll probably still go with this technique and add more steps if I find any more optimal strategies.
