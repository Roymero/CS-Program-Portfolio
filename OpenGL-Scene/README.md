# OpenGL Scene
- I approach designing this software by taking a picture of the scene I want to recreate, then identifying a center/main object, creating said object, and building the rest of my scene around it.
- I decided take an agile approach to designing this project. The development strategies I used to develop
this scene was work on a singular aspect each week. One week I worked on creating the shapes, the next I worked on the texture of my figures, 
then the following week on lighting, etc.
- Computational graphics and visualizations make me admire game and animated developers even more, 
I love this form of entertainment and this project strengthened that appreciation even more.
