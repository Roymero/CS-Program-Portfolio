# DrivePass System Design
- DrivePass is a new innovative and flexible application where users can sign up for driving lessons as well as study for their written license exam.
- I feel like excelled at creating the UML class diagram for the system, my brain wrapped around the concept successfully.
- If I had to revise one part of my project it could be the use case diagram, I would make it more in-depth and add several more use cases.
- I Interpreted the user's needs correctly by listening to what features they want and implementing them in my system design. 
- It is monumentally important to consider the userâ€™s needs when designing a system because the system is specifically for the users.
- I'm taking a more flexible approach to designing software, listening to user suggestions, considering what the user will consider helpful and also saying to myself 
"what features would I want if I were using this app as a consumer".
